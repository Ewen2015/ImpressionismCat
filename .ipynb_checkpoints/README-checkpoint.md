# ImpressionismCat, A Cat Full of Imagination
========================================

😸😹😺😻😼😽😾😿🙀🐱

GossipCat is a data science consulting framework that simplifies the process of machine learning from data cleaning, simple feature engineering, machine learning algorithm comparison, hyper parameter tuning, model evaluation, to results output. It is designed to be efficient with following features:

- Agile machine learning framework: designed with a lean start and continuing improvement.
- Pipeline data preprocessing: high cohesion, low coupling.
- Algorithm comparison: no free lunch in algorithm selection.
- Diverse model evaluation: makes the evaluation with business sense and visible. 
- Architectural thinking: not just data science but also machine learning engineering.


Story of the ImpressionismCat
----------------------

David, a cat of my friend Selia, is the ambassador of the project. 

Selia and me were co-workers at IBM and we met in a strategy project in the autum of Beijing in 2020. Since then I know Selia got a incredible cute cat. So when the project came into shape and needed an ambassador, her cute cat just came across my mind and I know that's it!
