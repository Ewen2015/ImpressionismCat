ImpressionismCat, A Cat Full of Imagination
===========================================

😸😹😺😻😼😽😾😿🙀🐱

ImpressionismCat is a deep learning project that applies most cutting edge techniques to make art.


Story of the ImpressionismCat
----------------------

David, a cat of my friend Selia, is the ambassador of the project. 

Selia and me were co-workers at IBM and we met in a strategy project in the autum of Beijing in 2020. Since then I know Selia got a incredible cute cat. So when the project came into shape and needed an ambassador, her cute cat just came across my mind and I know that's it!
